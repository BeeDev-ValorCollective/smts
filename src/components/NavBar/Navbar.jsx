/**
 * Navbar Component
 * 
 * This component displays the website's navigation bar. It dynamically generates the list of links based on data from a JSON file and excludes the current pageâ€™s link. 
 * The header includes the SMTS logo and a title, with the title adjusted for smaller screens. The navigation bar also includes a message encouraging users to make 
 * a call to Seniors Mobile Tax Services rather than driving.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - **Dynamic Link Rendering**: The list of navigation links is populated from a JSON file (`Links`), 
 *   excluding the link for the current page.
 * - **Responsive Design**: On smaller screens, the `h1` element (title) disappears, leaving just the logo for a more compact header.
 * - **Navigation Message**: A message urging users not to drive but to make the call to Seniors Mobile Tax Services is included in the footer of the navigation.
 * - **External Navigation**: The links lead to different pages in the application, each rendered via the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`.
 * 
 * Props:
 * - **`currentPath`** (`string`): The current page URL path, used to exclude the corresponding link from the list of navigation links.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * The Navbar component dynamically generates navigation links from a JSON file, adjusting for the current page and offering a responsive layout for different screen sizes.
